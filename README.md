# Simple PS3 DDR Dancemat Driver for Linux

This is a very simple Linux Kernel module for the PS3 DDR Dancemat.

This driver will properly map the Dancemats arrows to button hits instead of HAT movements.
This allows for LEFT+RIGHT and UP+DOWN hits.
All 11 buttons are mapped.

Installation instructions for Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch will be provided.
